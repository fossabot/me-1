                                I spent the last few years developing on smaller teams — for the newest of auto financing startups to the top name in property management software and I think that I've seen a bit of everything.

                                I've dealt with what happens when your sales team catches fire and you rack up technical debt to meet your deadlines, watched what happens when new hires drop production database tables (<CampaignLink href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/6ez8ag">the opposite of this</CampaignLink>), seen what happens to your team when you get acquired and then tried to keep spirits high after it gets liquidated. I know what it feels like to get laid off and see a <CampaignLink href="http://fetchauto.ca">startup fizzle out</CampaignLink>. I've seen a lot, learned a lot, failed a couple of times – <em>on both sides of the Atlantic now</em> – so I know I haven't done it all yet, and the best way for me to do that is to take a giant leap and hopefully land somewhere like {companyName ? companyName : "your company"}.
